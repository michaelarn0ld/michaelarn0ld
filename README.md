## Hello World
I'm a technologist with deep knowledge in platform and infrastructure development. Since May 24' I've been at Amazon in San Diego, where I build supply-side enforcement software for the Advertising Trust team. Before this, I spent a few years with Amazon Web Services in Palo Alto, where I designed and developed testing and deployment infrastructure for RDS Aurora MySQL.

I have experience developing resilient deployment frameworks for global services, designing fault-tolerant and scalable distributed systems, and collaborating with product managers to deliver software features used by millions of users.

I am a lifelong learner and am in love with the pursuit of personal growth. In my
free time, you're likely to find me engaged in one of my hobbies, or working on
some personal coding projects. Code reflects life, so I often try to codify various
components of my own life.
