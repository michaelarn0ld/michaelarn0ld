## Hello World
Hey everyone! My name is Michael Arnold; currently I work in Palo Alto, California
as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services. I am a part of the
Aurora MySQL team, mostly focusing on platform and infrastructure development.

I am a lifelong learner and am in love with the pursuit of personal growth. In my
free time, you're likely to find me either cooking, working out, or working on
some personal coding projects.

If you want to reach me, please check out my website or email me directly!
