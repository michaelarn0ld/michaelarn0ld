## Hello World
My name is Michael Arnold; currently I work in Palo Alto, California
as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services. I am a part of the
Aurora MySQL team, mostly focusing on platform and infrastructure development.

I am a lifelong learner and am in love with the pursuit of personal growth. In my
free time, you're likely to find me engaged in one of my hobbies, or working on
some personal coding projects. Code reflects life, so I often try to codify various
components of my own life.

If you want to reach me, please check out my website or email me directly
